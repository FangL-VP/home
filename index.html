        <!-- Introductory paragraph. -->
        <p>
          The Wonders of the Ancient World are seven unique structures that tell
          the tales of how civilizations left their marks on the world. Chosen
          by Hellenic travelers passing through Persian, Babylonian, and
          Egyptian lands, each wonder is extraordinary. From the lush,
          incredible architecture of Babylon, to the remarkable statue of Zeus
          at Olympia, these seven exceptional constructions will take your
          imagination to new heights.
        </p>

        <!-- First Wonder - The Great Pyramid of Giza. -->
        <h2 id="Pyramid" class="clear">1. Great Pyramid of Giza</h2>
        <img class="image" src="GreatPyramidOfGiza.jpg" alt="Great Pyramid of Giza" />
        <p>
          The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only complex that still exists in the
          world. In modern day geography, it exists in Greater Cairo, Egypt, by
          the west bank of the Nile River. The pyramid is known to be the oldest
          of the Giza pyramid complex, and also the oldest ancient wonder.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The proportions of the pyramid are mammoth - the base is 230m &#xd7;
            230m, with a height of 138.
          </li>
          <li>The giant pyramid was erected around 2560 B.C.E.</li>
          <li>Constructed over 27 years.</li>
          <li>
            2.3 million stone blocks were crafted for this monolith of a
            pyramid.
          </li>
          <li>Pyramid was built as a tomb for the benign pharaoh Khufu.</li>
          <li>The tallest man-made structure for over 3000 years.</li>
          <li>
            Khufu&rsquo;s vizier, Hemiunu, is believed to have been the
            architect of the Great Pyramid.
          </li>
          <li>
            5.5 billion kilograms of limestone, 8 million kilograms of granite,
            and 500 million kilograms of mortar were used for construction.
            (Over 2.3 million blocks)
          </li>
          <li>
            Pyramid was cased with while limestone on the outside. Over the
            course of history, the white limestone faded away.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Second Wonder - The Hanging Gardens of Babylon. -->
        <h2 id="HangingGardens" class="clear">2. Hanging Gardens of Babylon</h2>
        <img class="image" src="HangingGardensOfBabylon.jpg" alt="Hanging Gardens of Babylon, as depicted by H. Waldeck" />
        <p>
          There is no firsthand evidence that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon
          ever existed; however, it is still considered one of the wonders. The
          Hanging Gardens is the only wonder for which the location has not been
          definitely established, but archaeologists have narrowed it down to
          somewhere in modern day Iraq. It was described as an impressive array
          of blooming flowers, luscious fruit, exotic foliage, and grand
          waterfalls. The miraculous feat of engineering resembles a large green
          mountain built with mud bricks. It was believed that the Hanging
          Gardens were built around 600 B.C.E., by King Nebuchadnezzar II for
          his gorgeous wife, Queen Amytis. No ancient Babylonian texts have ever
          mentioned the existence of these gardens, and no definite
          archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon.
        </p>

        <!-- Third Wonder - The Statue of Zeus at Olympia in Western Greece. -->
        <h2 id="Zeus" class="clear">3. Statue of Zeus</h2>
        <img class="image" src="StatueOfZeus.jpg" alt="Statue of Zeus" />
        <p>
          To create this magnificent sculpture, it took the most renowned
          sculptor of the ancient era to do so. Phidias, who many historians
          consider to be one of the greatest ancient Greek architects, produced
          the statue worthy of the fabled god. Seated in the Temple of Zeus at
          Olympia in Greece, the statue showed Zeus seated on a throne crusted
          in gold, ivory, ebony, and precious stones. The creation was described
          to be Zeus, at a notable height of 12.4 meters, holding a statue of
          Nike, goddess of victory in his right hand and a scepter topped with
          an eagle on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grandiose statue was destroyed in the fifth century AD, after the
          statue was moved to Constantinople where it was later destroyed by the
          great fire of the Palace of Lausus, in 475 AD.
        </p>

        <!-- Fourth Wonder - Temple of Artemis. -->
        <h2 id="Artemis" class="clear">4. Temple of Artemis</h2>
        <img class="image" src="TempleOfArtemis.jpg" alt="Temple of Artemis" />
        <p>
          In Ephesus, a temple constructed that was so opulent it was described
          in Antipater of Sidon&rsquo;s list of the Seven Wonders as the
          following:
        </p>
        <p id="quote">
          &#8220;I have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road
          for chariots, and the statue of Zeus by the Alpheus, and the hanging
          gardens, and the colossus of the Sun, and the huge labour of the high
          pyramids, and the vast tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the house of
          Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their
          brilliancy, and I said, "Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked
          on aught so grand".&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;The Temple of Artemis was a Greek temple dedicated to the
          benevolent goddess of the hunt, Artemis. Originally constructed to
          celebrate Artemis, it became a revered place of worship as the years
          went past. The temple went through more rebuilding than any other
          wonder, being completely rebuilt twice. The final destruction was
          initiated by Herostratus, who sought fame by destroying the beautiful
          creation.&#8221;
        </p>

        <!-- Fifth Wonder - Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the tomb of Maussollos. -->
        <h2 id="Mausoleum" class="clear">5. Mausoleum of Halicarnassus</h2>
        <img class="image" src="MausoleumOfHalicarnassus.jpg" alt="Mausoleum of Halicarnassus" />
        <p>
          Among the most monumental structures to house the departed was the
          enormous Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. Also known as the Tomb of
          Mausolus, it was the final resting place of Maussollos, a governor in
          the Persian Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria, who
          initiated its construction in 351 BC. The structure was designed by
          Greek architects Pythius of Priene and Satyros. The mausoleum was said
          to be 41 meters high and was adorned with intricate exterior carvings
          and precious works of art. Though it stood hard and firm for
          centuries, a series of earthquakes finally tumbled it down somewhere
          between the 12th-15th century AD. It was the last surviving of the six
          destroyed wonders.
        </p>
        <p>The word Mausoleum is now used to describe an above-ground tomb.</p>

        <!-- Sixth Wonder - Colossus of Rhodes, statue of the sun god. -->
        <h2 id="ColossusOfRhodes" class="clear">6. Colossus of Rhodes</h2>
        <img class="image" src="ColossusOfRhodes.jpg" alt="Colossus of Rhodes, the Sun God Helios" />
        <p>
          Visitors to ancient Rhodes were greeted by a colossal statue of
          Helios, the Greek sun god. Built during 280 B.C.E. by the celebrated
          sculptor Chares of Lindos, it was built to commemorate the successful
          defense of Rhodes city against an attack by Demetrius Poliorcetes, who
          had besieged it for a year with a huge army and a large navy. After
          only existing for less than 60 years, an earthquake destroyed the
          statue. The Colossus stood 33 meters high before its destruction. The
          ruins of the statue remained a popular tourist attraction for more
          than 800 years.
        </p>

        <!-- Seventh Wonder - Lighthouse of Alexandria. -->
        <h2 id="Lighthouse" class="clear">7. Lighthouse of Alexandria</h2>
        <img class="image" src="PharosOfAlexandria.jpg" alt="Pharos of Alexandria" />
        <p>
          Considered a technical masterpiece that served as the model for all
          lighthouses that followed, the Lighthouse of Alexandria (also known as
          the Pharos of Alexandria) was a lighthouse built by the Greeks of
          Ancient Egypt, during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing over 107 meters tall and used as a navigational landmark for
          voyagers along the Egyptian coast, the lighthouse was created in three
          unique stages:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>A square stone base</li>
          <li>An octagonal middle section</li>
          <li>Cylindrical section at the very top</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To reflect light, at the apex a mirror was put to rebound sunlight. At
          night, a fire was lit to guide late travelers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century AD.
        </p>
        <p>
